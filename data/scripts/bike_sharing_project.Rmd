# About Data Analysis Report

This RMarkdown file contains the report of the data analysis done for the project on forecasting daily bike rental demand using time series models in R. It contains analysis such as data exploration, summary statistics and building the time series models. The final report was completed on `r date()`.

**Data Description:**

This dataset contains the daily count of rental bike transactions between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

**Data Source:** <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset>

# Task One: Load and explore the data
## Load data and install packages

```{r}
## Import required packages
install.packages("timetk")  # Install timetk package if not already installed
library(timetk)  # Load timetk package
data("bike_sharing_daily")  # Load the built-in R dataset
```

## Describe and explore the data

```{r}
View(bike_sharing_daily)  # View the dataset
summary(bike_sharing_daily)  # Summary statistics of the dataset
```

# Task Two: Create interactive time series plots

```{r}
## Read about the timetk package
# ?timetk

# Load the required package
library(plotly)

# Create interactive time series plot
plot_ly(data = bike_sharing_daily, x = ~dteday, y = ~cnt, type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "Daily Bike Rental Count",
         xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Count"))

```

# Task Three: Smooth time series data

```{r}

# Check if the 'count' variable exists in the dataset
if("cnt" %in% colnames(bike_sharing_daily)) {
  print("The 'count' variable exists in the dataset.")
} else {
  print("The 'count' variable does not exist in the dataset.")
}


# Convert the count variable into a time series object
ts_count <- ts(bike_sharing_daily$cnt, frequency = 365)

# Load the forecast package
library(forecast)

# Clean the time series data
cleaned_data <- tsclean(ts_count)

# Smooth the cleaned data using Simple Exponential Smoothing
smoothed_data_exp <- HoltWinters(cleaned_data)

# Load the TTR package
library(TTR)

# Smooth the cleaned data using Simple Moving Average with order 10
smoothed_data_sma <- SMA(cleaned_data, 10)


```

# Task Four: Decompose and assess the stationarity of time series data

```{r}

# Step 1: Check Data Availability
n_obs <- nrow(bike_sharing_daily)
print(n_obs)

# Step 2: Handle Missing Values
missing_values <- anyNA(bike_sharing_daily)
print(missing_values)

# Step 3: Adjust Frequency
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Aggregate daily data to monthly
bike_sharing_monthly <- bike_sharing_daily %>%
  mutate(month_year = floor_date(dteday, "month")) %>%
  group_by(month_year) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(cnt))

# Check the number of observations in the aggregated dataset
n_obs_monthly <- nrow(bike_sharing_monthly)
print(n_obs_monthly)

# Step 4: Verify Data Format
# Convert the aggregated monthly data to a time series object
ts_monthly <- ts(bike_sharing_monthly$total_count, frequency = 12)  # Assuming monthly frequency (12 months per year)


```

# Task Five: Fit and forecast time series data using ARIMA models

```{r}

# Example: Fit ARIMA model to monthly bike sharing data

# Load necessary libraries
library(forecast)

# Assuming bike_sharing_monthly$total_count contains your monthly bike sharing data

# Check the structure of your data
str(bike_sharing_monthly)

# Convert the total_count column to a time series object
ts_bike_sharing <- ts(bike_sharing_monthly$total_count, frequency = 12)  # Assuming monthly data

# Check the stationarity of the time series
# You can use ACF and PACF plots, as well as statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

# Example:
# acf(ts_bike_sharing)
# pacf(ts_bike_sharing)
# adf.test(ts_bike_sharing)

# Assuming your data requires first-order differencing to achieve stationarity
# You can determine the order of differencing (d) based on the differencing required to make the series stationary
d <- 1

# Fit an ARIMA model
arima_model <- auto.arima(ts_bike_sharing, d=d, seasonal=FALSE)

# Summary of the ARIMA model
summary(arima_model)

# Check residuals for normality
shapiro.test(residuals(arima_model))

# Forecast using the ARIMA model
forecast_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 12)  # Forecasting 12 months ahead

# Plot the forecast
plot(forecast_values)

```

# Task Six: Findings and Conclusions

Trend and Seasonality: The exploratory data analysis revealed a clear increasing trend in bike rental demand over the observed period. Additionally, seasonality was observed, with peaks in demand occurring during certain months of the year, due to seasonal variations such as weather conditions.
